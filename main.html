	<p id="des">Every human being has two different Selves: a “social” Self (the way in which the others perceive a given person), and a “personal” Self (how a certain person perceives himself/herself). Neither of these two is completely “objective” or “perfect”. For instance, you may conceive yourself as an intelligent and ambitious, but for your relatives you may seem rather a mediocre person, with plenty of weak points. There are discrepancies between both images, and it is far from easy to describe yourself in a way, which will demonstrate all of your negative and positive sides.The portfolio essay should begin with your introduction. Who are you? Why have you chosen the given course/class? What attracts you in writing? You have to present this information in one long paragraph - from five to ten sentences long.</p>
